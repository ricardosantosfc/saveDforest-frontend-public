# saveDforest Frontend Project
![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=flat&logo=angular&logoColor=white)

This repository contains the Angular frontend project of the web-app that supports the 'saveDforest' (v1) game - a browser based, serious game for promoting environmentally sustainable behaviors through empathy. 

While the game itself was built using Unity, the web-app that supports it is based on a MEAN stack.
