# saveDforest 1 Frontend Project

This repository contains the Angular-based frontend of the web-app that supports the 'saveDforest' (v1) browser game - a serious game for promoting environmentally sustainable behaviors through empathy. 

While the game itself was built using Unity, the web app is based on a MEAN stack.
